## About repo
This repository contains my practice in learning Unreal Engine. When I was just starting to learn the engine, I did small tests of mechanics, which are located in the Content/Tests folder. But then in the summer of 2024, I organized a marathon of learning Unreal Engine and learned 11 different topics, all of which were supported by practice and which are mostly located in the Content/Projects folder. List of large-scale topics learned during the marathon:
1. Unreal Motion Graphics (UI System)
2. AI Systems (BT)
3. Visual Effects (Niagara)
4. Sound Systems (Cues and Metasounds)
5. Physics Systems (Chaos)
6. Debugging / Optimization systems
7. Multiplayer
8. Blueprint and C++ combining
9. Animation Systems
10. Post-Processing Effects
11. Materials Development

## Conslusion
The contribution of all these mini-projects to my career is huge, thanks to them I was able to understand Unreal well, return to the level I had in Unity (and even more, I learned a lot of new topics unknown to me), and also generally understand my vector of development in gamedev. After the end of the marathon, I think I will delve deeper into C++ and learn it properly, finish my Arkanoid (a game without an engine), maybe even make my own microengine. I also realized that I need to move on to multiplayer games, because I have 3.5 years of experience behind me, but I understand almost nothing about them, and this needs to be corrected through practice, but already on real projects.
